Ho Hello There !

I bet you wondering why the custom libc ?

Well, all my freaking functions are NULL proof, so you wont be able to crash in a strcpy(NULL, str) like a total moron.

All those functions are super useful, we'll not talk about the catalloc one which is clearly for me, the best.

Most importantly, those implementations are insanely useful for Epitech's projects, I'm not asking you to copy them, but you
can try to recode them. Since my level of coding is improving all the time, those functions will be more and more sophisticated,
does not mean they'll be harder to understand.
>
For example, between my old my_printf and the new one, new_printf, well there is a HUUUUUUGE difference, first of all,
I'll not recode all funcitonnality of printf, I don't need it, but I've had the functions I needed in it.

The library is in constant changes, all the time.

Hope you'll find your soulmate in those lines.

KISS
